# Prismatic Hub

Prismatic hub is a free, open source, roblox exploit hub.
It's easy to use and resourceful.

In order to use this hub, open a luau client executor, in a supported game, such as Prison life, then execute the code on the prismatic hub main repo. 
It will take 20 - 30 seconds to load up, and will eventually give you all the supported scripts of the game.

This project was made by Ch4mpus for fun, and to see how vulnerabilities work and make a project out of it.
